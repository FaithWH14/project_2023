## Habbo Automation Scripting

I created an automation script to streamline the Habbo website login process. The script handles username and password entry, submits via the ENTER key, retrieves the authentication code for Habbo GUI login, and pastes the code into the designated form. Additionally, it enables actions such as speaking, walking, sitting, standing, dancing, and waving continuously.

Developed around December 2022, this project is currently inactive and not undergoing maintenance unless deemed necessary.

Plan to update the code on 2th December 2023 (27th November 2023)
